Vending Machine Project:


This was a partner project I completed with @cait-mede over the course of three days, written in Java.

The Vending Machine is a Command Line Application which allows a user to purchase various items.



Features of our Vending Machine:


Each time a new CLI begins, the machine is stocked via an input text file. 

Each item is stocked to a quantity of 5 items and the user navigates purchasing an item through a menu. 

A user must input money in whole dollar amounts to purchase an item.

When an item is dispensed, a message appears on the screen and the proper change is calculated.

Additionally, to prevent theft, each action a user takes is written to an audit file.

We have created a hidden function that keeps track of the total sales of the machine. 

We used jUnit testing to test that our vending machine gives proper change, and proper messages are displayed.
